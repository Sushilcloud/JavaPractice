package Ch17_StaticKeyword;

public class Static {

/*
Static element in java
Analogy Like a fixed list of ingredients in a recipe book, unchanged by instance.

        in java static method \variable belong to the class, not object . Access them via the class name without creating an instance

   example call sandwichmaker.displayRecipe() directly , without creating a sandwichMaker Instance

Non Static Element in Java

think a specific sandwich ingredients which can vary for each sandwich ,even if they follow the same recipe

in java a non static method of variable belongs to an instance of the class , you must create an object to access these elements.

/*
why cant we call non static method from static method
Recipe Book Static Method .. Contain instruction , but cant make a sandwich . static method belong to the class and dont
need an object

Chef(Non static Methods)Need to follow the recepe to make a sandwich . non static method need an instance chef to be called

in java Static Method --Like the recipe book, accessible directly.
