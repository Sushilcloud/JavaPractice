        /* Hierarchical Inheritance Explained
                Multiple child classes inherit from single parent class, sharing common feature while adding unique behaviour
                this ensure shared functionally and allow specialization.

          Key point
            Superclass: The parent class from which other classes inherit.
            Subclass:   The child class that inherit from superclass.
            Shared Behaviour:   Subclasses share the method and properties of the superclass.
            Specialized Behaviour:  Each subclass can have its own unique method and properties.


       INTRODUCTION TO Polymorphism

       Polymorphism allow a single method to perform differnt action , enhancing code flexibility.

       Types of Polymorphism
        Static (Compile Time)   Method overloading ; determined a compile time.
        Dynamic (Runtime)       Method overriding ; determined at runtime base on the object type.

        Static Polymorphism:    Static polymorphism uses method overloading , allowing multiple method using a same name
                                but different parameter . the compiler select the method bases on the signature at compile time

            Method Overloading: Enable using a single method with different name for different task based on input.
                                Like using a same tool screwdriver for different task depending on the situation.

        Dynamic Polymorphism:
